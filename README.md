Java Http Server -- Version 1

This is a very basic HTTP server using Java and the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming.
My intention with this project was to learn more about Socket Programming.
I used the Model-View-Architecture to create a very simple Http Server that can render a basic HTML file to the client.
I did not go in depth with this project as this is version 1.
I am using a learning strategy known as the 'Woodpecker method' which I learned from Chess.
I highly recommend looking into it! Version 2 of this project is on the way and I will heavily improve on this project.
